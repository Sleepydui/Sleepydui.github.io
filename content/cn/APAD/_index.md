{{<block class="note">}}
I was inspired by the story of [*This scientist read a paper every day for 899 days. Here’s what she learned*](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/this-scientist-read-research-academic-paper-every-day-what-she-learned), so I decided to try it myself: Dedicating half an hour everyday to reading papers. Let's see for how long I can keep doing it.
